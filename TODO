Grey-out "Diarization" and "VAD filter" buttons for now (they're not working well)

keep database of recorded meetings and their corresponding folders, transcription outputs, and summarization outputs. This will allow for easier retrieval and management of past recordings and their associated data.

This will provide a visual way to navigate through past recordings and access their associated data.
Add light and dark mode themes to the UI, allowing users to switch between them based on their preference.
Add functionality to pause, stop and continue transcription from previous state. This will allow users to not have to wait for the transcription in a single session.
